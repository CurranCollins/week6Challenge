# Week 6 Challenge

Week 6 challenge using a server-side API to create a weather dashboard

## Description

I started this project thinking I had a good grasp on APIs and Bootstrap so that I could create a webpage that is used to look up the weather in different cities around the world. I got an Api key for a weather database and linked Bootstrap in my HTML and wrote a function to show the info pulled from the API on my page, which I couldn't successfully do. I was able to get the typed in cities to save in local storage though. I learned that I need to spend more time on javascript.

## Usage

Active Webpage Link:
